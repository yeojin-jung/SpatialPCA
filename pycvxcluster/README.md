# pycvxcluster

Ports implementations of convex clustering algorithms to Python and gives sklearn-like interface. Planned to include ADMM (Chi, Lange 2015), SSNAL (Sun, Toh, Yuan 2021).

Installation: For now, download the folder, cd to the folder, run "pip install -e ."

Dependencies: Numpy, Scipy, scikit-learn, sckikit-sparse

IN DEVELOPMENT, future changes may cause backwards-compatability issues

To do:
* Documentation
* Logging
* Typing
* Testing
* Alternative to scikit-sparse methods
* More algorithms
* Code clean-up
* Fix examples
